Our previous plan, MetroFuture has guided the work of MAPC and many of its recommendations have been implemented. Three years ago when we started the next plan, MetroCommon 2050: Shaping our Region Together, we still however faced many of the same big challenges, such as a lack of affordable housing, the increasing negative impacts of climate change, an unreliable transportation system, and increasing income, wealth, and health disparities by race. In last 10 years, the negative impacts of climate change and neighborhoods and municipalities increasingly unaffordable to most residents have become even more of a crisis.</p><div class="reports-hero-content__button"><a href="" target="_blank">Read More</a></div></div></div></div><div class="hero-banner__arrow container margins"><img src="../images/mapc-logo.svg" class="logo" alt="logo_alt"/></div></section><section class="reports-index"></section><section class="reports-content"><div class="reports-content-container container margins"><div class="reports-content-intro"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>MetroCommon 2050 is Greater Boston’s next long-range plan.

The goals are intended to be bold yet achievable, not clinical or abstract. The goals avoid assuming current or anticipated systems will exist in 2050. They are also solutions agnostic. They don’t identify who will provide health care or how, just that everyone has it and it’s affordable. They reflect the values of the plan, which are equity, stewardship, resiliency, and prosperity. The goals are an idealized future and the plan’s recommendations provide a roadmap of how we can achieve the goals.</p><div class="reports-content-goals-grid"><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-green" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/getting-around-the-region"><h5>Getting Around the Region</h5><p>Traveling around Metro Boston is safe, affordable, convenient, and enjoyable.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-blue" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/homes-for-all"><h5>Homes for All</h5><p>All residents of Metro Boston have places to live that meet their needs, and that they can afford.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-blue" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/healthy-and-safe-neighborhoods"><h5>Healthy and Safe Neighborhoods</h5><p>We are safe, healthy, and connected to one another.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-purple" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/economic-security-and-prosperity"><h5>Economic Security</h5><p>Everyone has the financial resources to meet their needs and to live fulfilling lives.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-purple" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/economic-prosperity"><h5>Economic Prosperity</h5><p>Greater Boston’s economy benefits all in the region.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-purple" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/thriving-arts-culture-and-heritage"><h5>Thriving Arts, Culture, and Heritage</h5><p>Greater Boston is full of unique places and experiences that bring joy and foster diversity and social cohesion.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-red" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/dynamic-and-representative-governments"><h5>Dynamic and Representative Governments</h5><p>Local governments and regional agencies have the capacity and resources to deliver the services and supports our residents deserve, and to maintain and invest in our built and natural environments.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-yellow" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/a-climate-resilient-region"><h5>A Climate-Resilient Region</h5><p>Metro Boston is prepared for - and resilient to - the impacts of climate change.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-yellow" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/a-net-zero-carbon-region"><h5>A Net Zero Carbon Region</h5><p>The Metro Boston region is highly energy efficient and has reduced its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to net zero.</p></a><a class="reports-content-goals-card reports-content-goals-card-yellow" href="https://mapc.gitbook.io/metrocommon-2050-goals/goals/a-healthy-environment"><h5>A Healthy Environment</h5><p>Greater Boston’s air, water, land, and other natural resources are clean and protected - for us and for the rest of the ecosystem.</p></a></div><h3>How did we decide that these would be the MetroCommon 2050 goals?</h3><p>The first draft of the MetroCommon 2050 goals emerged from a thorough reassessment and restructuring of the goals in MetroFuture. MetroFuture is the 2008 regional plan that MAPC created with an immense amount of help and input from residents and experts alike. While we brought the MetroFuture goals up to date, we toured the region, asking residents, planners, and municipal and state leaders what they wanted life in the region to be like in the year 2050. We cataloged those visions, identified themes, and incorporated them into the draft of the updated goals. MAPC staff reviewed that first draft, adding context and refining terms and concepts. Next, the MetroCommon 2050 External Advisory Committee, a committee of stakeholders MAPC selected to guide our decision making throughout the regional plan update, provided feedback. We produced a second draft of the goals and turned them into a survey that allowed respondents to rate the goals, provide feedback on them, and propose new ones. We sent the survey out over social media, we included in our newsletter, we asked our partners to fill out, and we asked our partners to forward it to their partners. We received over 600 responses, which we also grouped into themes and incorporated into a third draft. The third draft was again presented to the External Advisory Committee who recommended that they be sent to MAPC’s Executive Committee for approval. On June 17th 2019 the Executive Committee provisionally approved the goals. We continued to gather feedback on the goals through May 2021 before finalizing them over the summer of 2021.</p></div><div class="reports-content-action-areas"><h2>Five interrelated topics: “Action Areas”</h2><div class="reports-content-action-areas-carousel"><div><h1>Carousel links to AA landing pages</h1><a href="/metrocommon-2050/action-areas/growth/">Inclusive Growth &amp; Mobility</a><a href="/metrocommon-2050/action-areas/housing/">Homes for Everyone</a><a href="/metrocommon-2050/action-areas/equity/">Equity of Wealth &amp; Health</a><a href="/metrocommon-2050/action-areas/governance/">Dynamic &amp; Representative Government</a><a href="/metrocommon-2050/action-areas/climate/">Climate Mitigation &amp; Resiliency</a></div></div><h3>What was the process for determining the content within the Action Areas?</h3><p>The Action Areas were informed by MAPC’s understanding of key issues facing the region, combined with years of public engagement that asked questions like: what future do you want to see for Greater Boston and what is preventing us from getting there? What are the key challenges and opportunities our region is facing? Where should we, collectively, focus our efforts to generate meaningful change? The narratives were honed with the help of MAPC staff, the MetroCommon 2050 Community Engagement Advisory Committee, the MetroCommon 2050 External Advisory Committee, and hundreds of participants from action area workshops spanning the summer and fall of 2020.</p><div class="reports-content-action-areas-nesting-viz"><h4>Action Areas (5)</h4><h4>Recommendations (20)</h4><h4>Strategies (68)</h4><h4>Policy Actions (227)</h4></div><div class="reports-content-action-areas-accordion"></div></div></div></section></div></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-9eed375774ee8789a052.js"],"app":["/app-fd3534366b10f4dc66f1.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-7e2c358159790f3b2af3.js"],"component---src-pages-action-areas-climate-js":["/component---src-pages-action-areas-climate-js-a4dd8e0d787e793ed737.js"],"component---src-pages-action-areas-equity-js":["/component---src-pages-action-areas-equity-js-7c6ea9e52894711569d1.js"],"component---src-pages-action-areas-governance-js":["/component---src-pages-action-areas-governance-js-cfc5cf7e0fcf7fe63adc.js"],"component---src-pages-action-areas-growth-js":["/component---src-pages-action-areas-growth-js-46a27ede2ad91a7929bc.js"],"component---src-pages-action-areas-housing-js":["/component---src-pages-action-areas-housing-js-cfc66de80fb8953b1c60.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-ccd50f228fc952c2f25a.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/metrocommon-2050/polyfill-9eed375774ee8789a052.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/metrocommon-2050/component---src-pages-index-js-ccd50f228fc952c2f25a.js" async=""></script><script src="/metrocommon-2050/app-fd3534366b10f4dc66f1.js" async=""></script><script src="/metrocommon-2050/framework-591a9ef45d7c27e402ec.js" async=""></script><script src="/metrocommon-2050/webpack-runtime-054003a499135e80088d.js" async=""></script></body></html>
