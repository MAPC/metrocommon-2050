We cataloged those visions, identified themes, and incorporated them into the draft of the updated goals. MAPC staff reviewed that first draft, adding context and refining terms and concepts. Next, the MetroCommon 2050 External Advisory Committee, a committee of stakeholders MAPC selected to guide our decision making throughout the regional plan update, provided feedback. We produced a second draft of the goals and turned them into a survey that allowed respondents to rate the goals, provide feedback on them, and propose new ones. We sent the survey out over social media, we included in our newsletter, we asked our partners to fill out, and we asked our partners to forward it to their partners. We received over 600 responses, which we also grouped into themes and incorporated into a third draft. The third draft was again presented to the External Advisory Committee who recommended that they be sent to MAPC’s Executive Committee for approval.
